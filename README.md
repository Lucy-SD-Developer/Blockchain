The requirements to run this are:-

1.python 3.6+(with pip)
2.pip install pipenv 
3.postman (this is used for hitting the rest calls)

Go to the folder in which you have downloaded the files and run:-
1. pipenv install 
2. pipenv run python blockchain.py

Now we need to create mulitple nodes. So create couple of more command line/terminal windows and run the below command
on 2nd terminal:

pipenv run python blockchain.py -p 5001

on 3rd terminal:

pipenv run python blockchain.py -p 5002
